            <p>Hi, my name is Douglas Caceres and I am from Guatemala, Guatemala, here in Guatemala
                we have many volcanoes, out of all these volcanoes 37 are recognized and I want to hike them all
                I have already hiked 26. Out of all these volcanoes some are located in hot areas so it becomes a little bit 
                difficult to hike them because you need to carry your wated with you, it's difficult to find natural 
                fountains of water in a volcano.
                Some are in areas that are cold but it's the same situation with water, you need to bring your own water.
                One of the most spectacular ones in located in the border of Mexico and Guatemala, it is the tallest in Central America. 
                It is called Volcan Tajumulco</p>
